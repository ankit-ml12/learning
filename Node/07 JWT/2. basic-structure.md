### What is the JSON Web Token structure?

- In its compact form, JSON Web Tokens consist of three parts separated by dots (.), which are:

1. Header
2. Payload
3. Signature

- Therefore, a JWT typically looks like the following.
  > xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz

---

### Let's break down the different parts.

1. Header

- The header typically consists of two parts: the type of the token, which is JWT, and the signing algorithm being used, such as HMAC SHA256 or RSA.

  > "typ": "JWT"
