### req object

```js
const http = require('http')

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  // req is giant obj contain lots of the details
  //one of which is Method what type of method user want GET, POST, DELETE, PUT
  //another is url give from which page user sending this request
  const url = req.url
  if (url === '/') {
    res.writeHead(200, { 'content-type': 'text/html' })
    res.write('<h1>Home Page</h1>')
    res.end()
  } else if (url === '/about') {
    res.writeHead(200, { 'content-type': 'text/html' })
    res.write('<h1>About Page</h1>')
    res.end()
  } else {
    res.writeHead(404, { 'content-type': 'text/html' })
    res.write('<h1>Page not Found</h1>')
    res.end()
  }
})
server.listen(5000)
```

- here issue of url is also resolved
  > Note:-
- to send html file just import that file and send that file
- event if you are sending html data from other file or sending a html file in response you will still have to define the content type
- Imp:- if you sending html file which content .css and .js file from our self then node send request for them also inside the server so you need to manage all that request also
