#### other method

```js
const express = require('express')
const path = require('path')
const app = express()
//the below method work but we have to care about static file like css, js
//so we add all them in public folder and import like this

app.use(express.static('./public'))
//use we use for static and middleware
//static is the file which server doesn't have to change

// to send a file we use sendFile
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
res.sendFile(path.resolve(**dirname, 'index.html'))
})

app.all('\*', (req, res) => {
res.status(404).send('resources Not Found')
})
app.listen(5000, () => {
console.log('sever is listing')
})
```
