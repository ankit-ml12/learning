#### req object

```js
const http = require('http')

we normally write code like this
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  console.log('user hit the server')
  res.end('hello ankit')
})
//we use requests to know what the user wants to know??
//and using response we send the user requirement from the server
server.listen(5000)
```

- dis:- on every page it show us hello ankit and we are not passing the header also
- now we are sending everydata as a string but what about other type
- req header:- The header tells the server details about the request such as what type of data the client, user, or request wants in the response. Type can be html , text , JSON , cookies or others.
- vice versa with the res header.

#### server with the header

```js
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  //status code and content type
  res.writeHead(200, { 'content-type': 'text/html' })
  res.write('<h1>hello krishna</h1>')
  //we can also pass this content in res.end() both are same
  res.end()
})
server.listen(5000)
```

- now type of content issue is resolved but similar content on all page is still exist

- use above link to read more about status code
