### express

- we use express to build server
- we can build with the help of node but it help us to do in better way
- express build on top of node or top of http module so its not like we are using express without node

> whenever we interect with server from the browser than it is exchage or information or we can say exchange of request messege and response messege.

- So request messages are what the user is sending.
- For example, if you open up the browser to search the web, or that could be your Web application.
- The remember, with Web applications, we also can make HTTP request correct.
- And that response is going to be our responsibility.
