#### Truthy and Falsy Values (optional)

Vanilla JS

In JavaScript, a value is considered "truthy" if it is evaluated to true when used in a boolean context. A value is considered "falsy" if it is evaluated to false when used in a boolean context.

Here is a list of values that are considered falsy in JavaScript:

1. false
2. 0 (zero)
3. "" (empty string)
4. null
5. undefined
6. NaN (Not a Number)
7. All other values, including objects and arrays, are considered truthy.
