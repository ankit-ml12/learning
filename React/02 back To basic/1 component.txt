"We write whole this thing in index.js in src to create Component and render on some id ";

function Greeting() {
  --> first character must be capital 
  -->here we have to return the JSX not HTML
  return <h1>Hello Ankit Patidar</h1>;
}

-->now I want to show this greeting component in root id which is present in /public/index..html file


-->to render this element we use the render method
-->we need to pass two things one which component you want to render and where you want to render
ReactDom.render(<Greeting />, document.getElementById("root"));

//second way to render is 
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Greeting />);

Note:-
1. use closing bracket in every component in image br etc
2. return only one component if it is multiple you can combine it in a single element
