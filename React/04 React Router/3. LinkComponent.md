#### Link Component

-if we want to move aroung the website or component we use LINK component from the react router app

- instead of link href of html
- if we want to move outside of website then we still need to to use the last html link method

```js
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom'

const Home = () => {
  return (
    <section className="section">
      <h2>Home Page</h2>
      <Link to="/about" className="btn">
        About
      </Link>
    </section>
  )
}
export default Home


import { Link } from 'react-router-dom'

const About = () => {
  return (
    <section className="section">
      <h2>About</h2>
      <Link to="/" className="btn">
        Back2Home
      </Link>
    </section>
  )
}
export default About
```
