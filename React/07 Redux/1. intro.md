- redux is not part of react but they offen used together
- Redux is a JavaScript library used to manage the state of an application. It helps developers manage and organize application data by providing a centralized store that holds all of the application's data in one place.

- When something changes in the application, such as a user clicking a button, an "action" is dispatched to the Redux store. The store then updates the application's state based on the action that was dispatched, and any components that are subscribed to changes in the store will receive those updates.

- Redux is often used with frameworks like React to simplify the management of application state and to make it easier to build complex, data-driven applications.
